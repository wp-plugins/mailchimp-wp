= Does this plugin work with MailChimp groups? =
Not at this time. We might add support for MailChimp groups in the future if there's popuplar demand for it. If you'd like to see this feature, please leave a comment in the suppport forum.

= How to add MailChimp forms to my site? =
You can add MailChimp optin forms to your site by going to Optin Cat -> Add New. 

First you'll have to choose a MailChimp form type - sidebar widget, post box (goes inside of a WordPress post or page), or lightbox popup.

Then choose a layout and modify the text, colors and design using the point & click editor.

Afterwards, connect the from to the MailChimp API and select a Thank You page.

Finally, publish your MailChimp form. This varies based on the MailChimp form type - instructions can be found in the user interface.

= Which MailChimp form-type is right for me? =
If your blog has a sidebar (like most blogs), you should definitely set up a MailChimp form and place it at the top of your sidebar. This is a quick & easy win.

Adding a MailChimp post box to the bottom of your blog posts is highly recommended. Readers are highly engaged after reading a post and will be more likely to opt in. For extra effectiveness, you could set up individual MailChimp forms with unique call to actions & text for each category. This will result in even more MailChimp subscribers.

The most effective way to grow your list is our MailChimp popup. This MailChimp form is a lot more agressive than sidebar widgets & post boxes so it should be used with care. The [premium version of this plugin](https://fatcatapps.com/optincat/upgrade/m?utm_campaign=description%2Bcta&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fmailchimp-wp%2F&utm_medium=referral) comes with some advanced settings that let you fine-tune the popup further so you can maximize conversions while not annoying your users.

To recap, the most effective & aggressive MailChimp form is the popup. The MailChimp post box will get you less conversions, but it's a lot more subtle. Finally, the MailChimp sidebar widget will most likely get you the least conversions. Nonetheless, it's worth setting up since it's a quick and easy win.

Your MailChimp form analytics will be displayed as a beautiful graph in your WordPress dashboard, plus you can view each individual form's stats by going to Optin Cat -> All Optin Forms. You can also reset the stats of each MailChimp form by going above screen, hovering over the form and clicking "Reset Stats".

= Do I need to set up a thank you page? How does it work? =
Whenever a MailChimp form was sucessfully submitted, the new subscriber will be redirected to a thank you page.
A Thank You page is a normal WordPress page. It's recommended that you add some text like "Thanks for subscribing, please check your email". Even better, you could add some further call to action such as "like us on Facebook" or "check out our products".

Setting up a Thank You page is required.
